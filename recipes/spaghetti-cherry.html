    <img src="https://www.lastingredient.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/burst-tomato-pasta15.jpg" width='400'/>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound dry pasta </li>
        <li> Kosher salt</li>
        <li> 4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li> 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes (about 2 pints; 750g)</li>
        <li> 1 ounce fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (about 1 cup; 30g)</li>
        <li> Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li> Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>    
    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>        
        <li> Place pasta in a large skillet or saut√© pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil until just shy of al dente, about 1 minute less than the package instructions.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, heat the garlic and 4 tablespoons olive over in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst. You can help them along by pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.</li>
        <li> Continue to cook until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in basil and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li> When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving a cup of pasta water. Add pasta to sauce and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly, and adding pasta water as necessary to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow. Remove from heat, stir in remaining olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan at the table.</li>
